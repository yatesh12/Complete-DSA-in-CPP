### Complete DSA in C++

Comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms solutions in C++ for interview prep and competitive programming. Covers arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, recursion, and common problem templates with clean, optimized, and well-documented code.

---

### Key Features
- **Wide coverage**: Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Sorting, Searching, and more.  
- **Interview-focused**: Common patterns, edge cases, and explanation comments for each solution.  
- **Reusable templates**: Ready-to-use snippets for DFS/BFS, binary search, two pointers, sliding window, union-find, segment trees, and DP memoization.  
- **Optimized solutions**: Time and space complexity noted for each problem.  
- **Consistent style**: Clear naming, modular functions, and minimal dependencies so files compile independently.

---

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yatesh12/Complete-DSA-in-CPP.git
cd Complete-DSA-in-CPP
```
2. Compile a single file (example):
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 path/to/file.cpp -O2 -o file && ./file
```
3. Use templates by copying from **/templates** into your solution file and adapting input/output as needed.

---

### How Problems Are Organized
- Files named as `<leetcode-id>-<problem-slug>.cpp` when applicable.  
- Each file begins with a short problem description, complexity analysis, and example usage.  
- Templates folder contains ready functions: `binary_search.cpp`, `dfs_template.cpp`, `bfs_template.cpp`, `union_find.cpp`, `segment_tree.cpp`, `bitmask_dp.cpp`.

### Contribution Guidelines
- **Issue**: Open an issue if a problem is missing, incorrect, or needs optimization.  
- **Pull Request**: Fork the repo, create a feature branch, add your solution following the repository style, include problem link and complexity, then open a PR.  
- **Code rules**: Use C++17, include brief comments, handle edge cases, keep functions modular, add tests or sample input where possible.
